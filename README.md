# Microcar

This Microsoft MakeCode package is used for ACA courses as a unified extension to control the **Grove Zero - BitKit microcar** for micro:bit, including extra blocks.

## Basic Usage

### 2. The blocks

There's currently 4 block sections:

* Calibrate

#### 2.1 Microcar
This is a clone of the BitKit extension - might remove some blocks to simplify things

#### 2.2 Digger
This simulates a digging explosion.

#### 2.3 Grid
Allows students to move the microbit like a beebot. Also includes setup block.

#### 2.4 Calibrate
Two blocks that make the car drive forwards and spin for calibration purposes.
